          <h2>Sales</h2>
          <p>
            Working with Broad group for nearly the past five years, I have inculcated in me an ability to connect with new people, and pitch my product in such a way, that the customer sees value in them.
I actually test in the market and pitch according to varying needs of different customers.

          <h2>Marketing</h2>
          <p>
            “I believe that a business without efficient marketing is like a toothless tiger”. I have been working in the arena of marketing alongside Sales at Broad, and completed a meaningful internship in marketing at IIM Lucknow, from April to July 2016. I have also been a Chief Marketing Officer at Jarvis tech, a startup that I also co-founded, from April,2016 to May,2017. Also, my experience in Sales has given me a strong advantage in the field of marketing as my ideas are market-tested, and have active feedback from customers, helping me to identify what will appeal to different people.

          <h2>Business and Market Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            I have a steady understanding of the market and can identify trends with adequate research. My training at Futures First, Jaipur from May to December, 2017 was instrumental in understanding this, and achieving competency in this field.
An active involvement in the market has given me an understanding in understanding the functioning and the depths of the market.
